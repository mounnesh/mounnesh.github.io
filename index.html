<img src="https://www.iplocation.net/assets/images/blog/featured/www.jpg">
<h2>The World Wide Web is based on several different technologies: Web browsers, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
    Web Browser: The web browser is an application software to explore www (World Wide Web).
     It provides an interface between the server and the client and requests to the server for web documents and services.
     The World Wide Web (WWW), often called the Web, is a system of interconnected webpages and information that you can access using the Internet.
     It was created to help people share and find information easily, using links that connect different pages together.
      The Web allows us to browse websites, watch videos, shop online, and connect with others around the world through our computers and phones.
      All public websites or web pages that people may access on their local computers and other devices through the internet are collectively known as the World Wide Web or W3.
      Users can get further information by navigating to links interconnecting these pages and documents.
      This data may be presented in text, picture, audio, or video formats on the internet.

<h1>What is WWW?</h1>
<h2>WWW stands for World Wide Web and is commonly known as the Web. The WWW was started by CERN in 1989. 
     WWW is defined as the collection of different websites around the world, containing different information shared via local servers(or computers).
     Web pages are linked together using hyperlinks which are HTML-formatted and, also referred to as hypertext, these are the fundamental units of the Internet and are accessed through Hypertext Transfer Protocol(HTTP).
     Such digital connections, or links, allow users to easily access desired information by connecting relevant pieces of information.
    The benefit of hypertext is it allows you to pick a word or phrase from the text and click on other sites that have more information about it.

<h1>History of the WWW</h1>
<h2>It is a project created, by Tim Berner Lee in 1989, for researchers to work together effectively at CERN. It is an organization, named the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which was developed for further development of the web.
     This organization is directed by Tim Bernerâ€™s Lee, aka the father of the web.  CERN, where Tim Berners worked, is a community of more than 1700 researchers from more than 100 countries. 
    These researchers spend a little time on CERN and the rest of the time they work at their colleges and national research facilities in their home country, so there was a requirement for solid communication so that they can exchange data.
 </h2>
<h1>Working of WWW</h1>
<h2>A Web browser is used to access web pages. Web browsers can be defined as programs which display text, data, pictures, animation and video on the Internet.
     Hyperlinked resources on the World Wide Web can be accessed using software interfaces provided by Web browsers.
     Initially, Web browsers were used only for surfing the Web but now they have become more universal.

    The below diagram indicates how the Web operates just like client-server architecture of the internet.
     When users request web pages or other information, then the web browser of your system request to the server for the information and
      then the web server  provide requested services to web browser back and finally the requested service is utilized by the user who made the request.

<h1>Features of WWW</h1>
<h2>
    <li>WWW is open source.</li>
    <li>It is a distributed system spread across various websites.</li>
    <li>It is a Hypertext Information System. </li>
    <li>It is Cross-Platform. </li>
    <li>Uses Web Browsers to provide a single interface for many services.</li>
    <li>Dynamic, Interactive and Evolving.   </li>
</h2>
<h1>Components of the Web</h1>
<h2>
    <li>Uniform Resource Locator (URL): URL serves as a system for resources on the web. </li>
    <li>Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP specifies communication of browser and server.</li>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
    <li>Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML): HTML defines the structure, organisation and content of a web page.</li>
